This is the plugin for exporting from Maya to OGRE mesh and skeleton formats.

1)Copy ogreExporter.mll to your maya plug-ins directory (I.E.: C:\Program Files\Alias\Maya7.0\bin\plug-ins)

2)Copy Ogre dlls (you can find them in the "dlls" directory of this zip) to your maya bin directory
(I.E.: C:\Program Files\Alias\Maya7.0\bin)

3)Copy ogreExporter.mel (from the "mel" directory of this zip) to your maya scripts directory 
(I.E.: C:\Documents and Settings\user\My Documents\maya\6.5\scripts)

4)If you already have a userSetup.mel in your scripts folder, then append the line 
	source ogreExporter.mel;
to the existing userSetup.mel.
If you don't have a userSetup.mel file in your scripts directory, then copy there the one you find in
the "scripts" directory of this zip.

The exporter can now be used safely via script, here's the syntax:

ogreExport 	generalOptions 

		["-mesh" meshFilename meshOptions]
			export mesh to .mesh binary file

		["-mat" matFilename matOptions]
			export materials to .material script file

		["-skel" skelFilename]
			export skeleton to .skeleton binary file
	
		["-skeletonAnims" skelAnimsOptions ["-skeletonClip" clipName clipOptions] ["-clip" ...] [...] ]
			export skeleton animations to the .skeleton file 
			[requires -skel]

		["-vertexAnims" ["-vertexClip" clipName clipOptions] ["-clip" ...] [...] ]
			export vertex animations as morph animations to the .mesh file 
			[requires -mesh]

		["-blendShapes"]
			export blend shapes as mesh poses to the .mesh file 
			[requires -mesh]

		["-BSAnims" ["-BSClip" clipName clipOptions] ["-clip" ...] [...] ]
			export blend shape animations as pose animations to the .mesh file 
			[requires -mesh]

		["-particles" particlesFilename]
			export particles to .particle file


generalOptions:
	"-sel" | "-all"		export whole scene or only selected objects
	"-world" | "-obj"	export in world or object coordinates
	"-lu " "pref | mm | cm | m | in | ft | yd"	select length unit for export
							("-lu pref" means to get unit from scene
								preferences)

	
meshOptions:
	["-shared"]		export using shared geometry
	["-v"]			export vertex bone assignements
	["-n"]			export vertex normals
	["-c"]			export vertex colours
	["-t"]			export texture coordinates
	["-edges"]		generate mesh edge list
	["-tangents"]		generate tangents

matOptions:
	["-matPrefix" prefix]	add prefix to all exported materials names [optional]
	["-copyTex" outDir]	copy textures used in the exported materials to outDir [optional]
	["-lightOff"]		export materials with lighting off [optional]

skelAnimsOptions:
	"-np" ( "curFrame" | "bindPose" | "frame" n )	specify neutral pose, can be current frame or bind pose or specified frame

clipOptions:
	"startEnd" s e ("frames" | "seconds") | "timeSlider"	specify clip range with start/end time or use time slider range
