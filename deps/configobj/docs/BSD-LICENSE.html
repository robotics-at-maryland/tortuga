<p>This is the <a class="reference" href="http://www.opensource.org/">OSI</a> Approved license that the Voidspace modules and programs are
available under <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1" name="id1">[1]</a>. It's often reffered to as the <em>BSD License</em>.</p>
<p>It is a very unrestrictive license but it comes with the usual disclaimer.
This is free software: test it, break it, just don't blame me if it eats your
data ! Of course if it does, let me know and I'll fix the problem so that it
doesn't happen to anyone else  <img src="smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" height="15" width="15" /> .</p>
